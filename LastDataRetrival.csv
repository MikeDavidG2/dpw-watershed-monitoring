Do NOT use Excel to edit the date and time directly. Use a simple text editor like Notepad instead. The 3rd row should be the last time AGOL data was successfully retrieved.  It should be in '01/03/2016 01:01:01 AM' format to be properly read by the script
Last time AGOL data was successfully retrieved:
03/01/2017 01:58:34 PM
